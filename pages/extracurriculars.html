                I am also an EDGE mentor part of WIC at UCSD. As a mentor, I am paired with a highschool student
                who is interested in pursuing the same field I am in. Every week, we meet up and talk about goals,
                motivation, strategies, and other things that can help the student with their passion to be a women in STEM.
