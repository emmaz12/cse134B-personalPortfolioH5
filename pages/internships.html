                    Worked within Android Core Experiments and Gantry to develop and implement new feature 
                    flags for project workflows using Java, TypeScript, Guice (dependency injection), and Redux. 
                    Designed and implemented Remote Procedure Calls to enable seamless backend communication, 
                    and developed numerous frontend features where the RPCs were integrated, resulting in 
                    dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. Optimized and tested features in order to ensure 
                    seamless integration, performance, and effectiveness. Collaborated effectively within 
                    cross-functional teams, leveraging strong communication and problem-solving skills to 
                    drive project success and ensure alignment with overall goals.

                    Worked with Professors Curt Schurgers and Ramsin Khoshabeh to design and 
                    create an enhanced access control system for numerous spaces at UCSD including 
                    the ECE MakerSpace and Envision Lab. My work is largely based as a backend developer 
                    where I utilize tools such as MySQL, TypeScript, Express.js, and Node.js to create 
                    a centralized database and server capable of storing numerous data records and efficiently 
                    handling data retrieval and manipulation operations. Through this process, 
                    I developed and implemented RESTful APIs utilizing HTTP methods to enable seamless 
                    communication between our client’s backend systems, in order to ensure efficient data retrieval, 
                    manipulation, and storage operations.

                    Triton Software Engineering is a multidisciplinary student organization at UC San Diego. 
                    Partnering with nonprofit organizations, we design and develop software pro-bono for social good. 
                    I work as software developer currently implementing and programing a fully functional web and 
                    mobile application for the San Diego County Taxpayers Association. Within this project, 
                    I mainly utilize MongoDB, Express, React, Node, React Redux to translate designs into code. 
                    In addition, I am currently creating front and backend features and implementations such as a 
                    user profile page.

                    Triton Robotics is a student organization participating in RoboMaster, an international robotics 
                    competition. I work to code an STM-32 nucleo board to control motors, sensors, and actuators 
                    allowing for robot movement. My past project worked on developing Mutex threading in order to 
                    more efficiently print to console while simultaneously running robot code without damaging data. 
                    Currently, I am working on creating a centralized turret class capable of managing and operating 
                    all functionality of shooting and aiming for numerous different robots. Throughout these projects, 
                    I have mainly utilized C++ and Mbed OS within a Linux environment to implement different functionalities.
