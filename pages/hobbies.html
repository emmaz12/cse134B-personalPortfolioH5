                <h3>Crocheting</h3>
                <p>
                    Last year, I learned how to crochet for the first time! I found out about a company called 
                    <dfn>Woobles</dfn>, whose mission is to create <em>easy to learn, beginner friendly</em> crochet kits. These kits include
                    everything you need to crochet a small animal! Ever since, I have been making crochet animals for friends and family.
                    It is a great way to destress during exam seasons and to kill some time when bored!

                <em>"The Woobles is actually about more than just crochet. It’s about proving to yourself 
                that you can always learn something new. Changing how you see yourself and your potential to grow. 
                And building the confidence that you can take on whatever comes your way."</em><cite> <strong>-Woobles Founders</strong></cite>

                <p>
                    I have played competitive volleyball for around 5 years before college in the <abbr>AVA</abbr> (Alberta Volleyball Association) league. Now at UCSD, I like to 
                    attend open gyms, play intramurals, or play for fun with friends! It is a great way to have come
                    competitive spirit in my life and also its great exercise!

                <h3>Netflix</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy watching Netflix as a way to relax and unwind. Whether it’s catching up on the latest shows, 
                    rewatching old favorites, or discovering new movies, it’s a fun way to take a break. I also like 
                    discussing shows with friends and getting recommendations for what to watch next. 
                    <del>Definitely not spending hours scrolling just to end up watching nothing.</del> <ins>It’s a great way 
                    to stay entertained and explore different genres!</ins> Some of my favorite movies and shows are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action</li>
                        <li>Ocean's 8</li>
                        <li>Game of Thrones</li>
                        <li>Mystery</li>
                        <li>Shutter Island</li>
                        <li>Dr. House</li>
